Then it's up to you. Do you respect the gumption or decide to break some windows?\n\nNo matter what， once your protection is accepted， they'll drop off their donations at the closest <sprite name="ui pip front extortion"> <link="fronts">front</link>.

info.rivals.name	Rival Outfits
info.rivals.desc	This town might not be big enough for everyone.\n\nTurns out that making a go of it on the black market during Prohibition wasn't a terribly uncommon idea. While most of the criminal activity in the city is limited to some <sprite name="ui goon defiant"> <link="goons">small time corner hooligans</link>， there are a few other outfits in town that could rival yours. As you run into them， they may decide to ignore you. They may decide that you're a threat. Or you may decide to make yourself into a threat.\n\nOpen <sprite name="ui ai aggro"> <link="hostility">conflict</link> is bad for business， but sometimes it can't be avoided. It's up to you as the outfit boss to decide what can be avoided and what must be faced head-on when it comes to your rivals.
info.hostility.icon	<sprite name="ui ai aggro">
info.hostility.name	Hostility & Conflict
info.hostility.desc	When others decide that their dislike for your outfit requires action.\n\nThere could be many reasons that a <sprite name="ui goon defiant"> <link="goons">local hooligan</link> or <link="rivals">rival outfit</link> has decided to escalate things from mutual distrust into open conflict.\n\nFor local hooligans， this means that they'll attack your crew members if they get too close to their controlled <sprite name="ui corner"> <link="corners">corner</link> and they may chase after your crew members for a few corners. If you previously had a deal with them to transact commerce with <link="businesses">businesses</link> on their corner， that arrangement will end as will any deal that was made where they agreed to stop bothering local merchants. \n\nSome triggers for conflict with local hooligans include spending too much time on their corner， doing something hostile to one of their family members， or attacking them directly. Also， some local hooligans are just touchy about newcomers and may be immediately hostile toward your outfit. But that will eventually pass as they become accustomed to your presence.\n\nWhen a rival outfit is hostile toward you， they have a whole range of options. They will sometimes gather their crew and target one of your crew members for <sprite name="ui combat"> attack. If they're well-armed， that could be quite unfortunate for that crew member and at worst could result in their <sprite name="ui dead crew"> death.\n\nThey may target your <sprite name="ui pip territory expand"> <link="fronts">fronts</link> and convince the business owner that it's best that they <sprite name="ui player lost front"> close down the front.\n\nYour <sprite name="ui pip social expansion"> <link="controlled-buildings">controlled buildings</link> will be vulnerable to <sprite name="ui ai building attack"> attack and damage， leaving them unable to function until repaired.\n\nThey may start <sprite name="ui corner raided"> raiding corners near your outfit， causing the businesses there to stop buying and selling with you for a time and causing some social unpleasantness as they report the negative results of being associated with your outfit.\n\nIn either case， you should expect a lot of <sprite name="ui heat"> <link="heat">heat</link> and the resulting increase in attention from the <sprite name="police station"> <link="police">local cops</link>.\n\nThis can all get very expensive and make your outfit's existence even more precarious. For local hooligans， you can simply demand that they stop. If your outfit has more manpower and weaponry than they do， they're likely to slink back to their corner and leave you alone.\n\nFor rival outfits， you need to go ask them for a <sprite name="ui truce started"> <link="truce">truce</link> which will put a pause on hostility for a while. 
info.truce.icon	<sprite name="ui truce started">
info.truce.name	Truces
info.truce.desc	Sometimes conflict is necessary. Sometimes it's just bad for business.\n\nIf you're engaged in <sprite name="ui ai aggro"> <link="hostility">hostilities</link> with a <link="rivals">rival outfit</link>， you can request a truce from them or they may request one from you. If you request it， it's likely that the other outfit will want you to pay for it， so they'll demand some amount of cash to cease hostilities.\n\nIf， however， the rival outfit approaches you and asks you to meet one of their crew on neutral ground， that means that they've decided the current conflict is not going their way. In this case， your outfit will be the ones receiving the cash to end the unpleasantness.\n\nOnce a truce has commenced， the rival outfit will cease all provocative action for the duration of the truce. If， however， you decide to take hostile action against a rival with whom you have a truce， you should expect a full and immediate resumption of hostile action.
info.relationships.icon	<sprite name="ui pip social">
info.relationships.name	Relationships & Trust
info.relationships.desc	In the city's underworld， who you know and who to trust are critically important to your outfit's success.\n\nYour relationship score summarizes your history with another person. It is influenced by direct positive interactions like cutting someone a break on prices or completing a mission for them. Or those direct interactions can be negative like demanding that they pay you <sprite name="ui tribute"> <link="protection">protection money</link> or failing to help them keep a <sprite name="ui goon defiant"> <link="goons">hostile local hooligan</link> from vandalizing their business.\n\nRelationships can also be influenced by personality features - like if you're both the same <sprite name="ui ethnicity general"> <link="ethnicity">ethnicity</link>， that will result in a higher relationship score and greater trust. On the other hand， they could be cautious by nature and that would lead them to trust you less right away.\n\nBut consequences also spread socially. If you help someone by completing a mission， that results in a positive relationship boost with their entire family. Likewise， if you break someone's windows， they're likely to inform everyone they know that you're not to be trusted， so expect negative relationship impacts.\n\nOnce someone trusts you enough， they will reveal what illegal activities they might want to discuss with you. If they trust you considerably， they will offer you <sprite name="ui tickets"> <link="favors">favors</link> such as introductions， skills and lots of other extremely helpful benefits.\n\nSo keep in mind， your actions， both positive and negative resonate socially.
info.missions.icon	<sprite name="ui quests">

As your organization grows and expands in different directions， the people in the city with whom you regularly transact commerce will keep up with your outfit's comings and goings. As such， they may sometimes have opportunities to present to you. These could increase your productivity， they might result in learning about a new <sprite name="ui skills"> <link="skills">skill</link>， discovering a previously unknown <link="resources">resources</link>， gaining weaponry or <link="vehicles">vehicles</link>， adding <sprite name="ui tickets"> <link="favors">favors</link> or otherwise materially advancing your efforts to conquer the city's crime landscape.\n\nSometimes the requirements of these missions may need to be fulfilled by a specific date， but sometimes they're more open-ended and can be completed when your outfit is ready. \n\nAs your <sprite name="ui pip territory expand"> <link="territory">territory</link> and <sprite name="ui crew list"> <link="crew">crew</link> grow， so will the number of missions that you're able to have concurrently active. Citizens will only offer you new missions if you're able to accept them， so once one is completed， look around the city to see if any new ones have popped up.\n\nKeep your crew on the lookout for new missions—they can be useful opportunities. If you help someone out， they'll tell others about your stand-up actions which could further broaden your opportunities. Likewise， if you agree to help and go back on your word， you may become known as untrustworthy in certain circles.

tut.newgamepopup.name	<b>{name}</b>\n\n{ageinfo}
tut.newgamepopup.text1	You finally arrive in the big city: <b>{cityname}.</b>
tut.newgamepopup.text2	The year is 1920， dawn of the Gilded Age. The country is prosperous but divided. The National Prohibition Act just made it illegal to sell， manufacture， or transport alcoholic beverages anywhere in the country. The law is seen as an attack on city residents and immigrants who don't support the temperance movement. Naturally， nobody in the city takes this law seriously: illegal speakeasies and alcohol operations are popping up all over， and it's easy to persuade the police to look the other way.
tut.newgamepopup.text3.m	You arrive into this melting pot with a few dollars in your pocket and a family connection. You're staying with your uncle， <b>{name}.</b> He has a small business in the city， and he's going to show you the ropes.
tut.newgamepopup.text3.f	You arrive into this melting pot with a few dollars in your pocket and a family connection. You're staying with your aunt， <b>{name}.</b> She has a small business in the city， and she's going to take you under her wing.
tut.newgamepopup.text4	But you don't want to run the family store. You dream about making it big， and this situation is full of opportunities for someone like you: someone who's not afraid to take risks.
tut.newgamepopup.text5	As you get off the train， and take in the sights of skyscrapers and endless crowds， you already know: this is the beginning of something great.

tut.lesson-1.title	Look Around
tut.lesson-1.1.m	<i>{fr} approaches you as you get off the train.</i>\n{name}， my dear nephew! It's so good to see you. How do you like our neighborhood? Sure， it may not look like much， but it's ours.\nLet me show you around!
tut.lesson-1.1.f	<i>{fr} approaches you as you get off the train.</i>\n{name}， my dear niece! It's so good to see you. How do you like our neighborhood? Sure， it may not look like much， but it's ours.\nLet me show you around!
tut.lesson-1.2	The first thing to learn is looking around!\nPress <b>W， A， S， and D</b> keys to look around. You can also click and drag with the <sprite name="tut mouse left"> <b>left mouse button.</b>
tut.lesson-1.3	Now to zoom in and out， use <b>F and R</b> keys， or use the <sprite name="tut mouse middle"> <b>mouse wheel</b>. Try it now.
tut.lesson-1.4	Finally to rotate the map， use they keys <b>Q and E</b>， or click and drag with the <sprite name="tut mouse middle"> <b>middle mouse button</b>.
tut.lesson-1.5	And by the way， the <sprite name="tut mouse right"> <b>right mouse button</b>， and the <b>ESC</b> key， can be used to close dialogs and popup windows (except for this dialog window).
tut.lesson-2.title	Who Are You?
tut.lesson-2.1	This blue marker represents <b>you</b> on the game map， and it will follow your car as you drive around.\nClick on it to select it.
tut.lesson-2.2	Do you see the bright， orange column of light above your marker? That shows you that you're currently <b>selected</b> to perform various actions.
tut.lesson-2.3	You can see all the information about the selected person on the right side of the UI.\nLet's examine it in order.
tut.lesson-2.4	First is the person's mugshot， same as on the marker， so it's easy to identify who's who.
tut.lesson-2.5	Second is the vehicle they're driving， assuming they're assigned to one.
tut.lesson-2.6	Right next to that are your <sprite name="ui action pts"> action points， which determine how much you can do per turn， and...
tut.lesson-2.7	... and <sprite name="ui movement pts"> movement points， which determine how far you can drive per turn.\nYou use those up， as you drive around and get things done.
tut.lesson-2.8	If this person is assigned to a car， you will see its inventory right below.
tut.lesson-2.9	Meanwhile， right below the person's portrait， you can see their traits and details of their past experience.\nMoving your mouse over any of these elements will reveal more details. Go ahead， try it!
tut.lesson-2.10	Finally， to select somebody， you have three options: you can click on their marker (above the car)， or click on their crew card (in the upper right corner of your screen)， or press the number <b>1</b> key to select the first crew member.\nPressing a number key once will select the crew member， while a quick double-press will also pan the camera over.\nTry it out now! Press the number <b>1</b> key， or use either of the other methods.
tut.lesson-3.title	Cars， Cash， and More
tut.lesson-3.1	Now let's look at your cash and vehicles.
tut.lesson-3.2	Up here you can see your <b>cash.</b> This is the total stored in all your buildings and vehicles.\nMove your mouse over it， to see how much you have in which location - and also， how much you've gained or lost last turn.
tut.lesson-3.3	Next are your <b>vehicles</b>: <sprite name="ui car"> cars and <sprite name="ui truck"> trucks. Next to each you have the number owned， and the max number you can handle at the moment.\nYou will need parking spaces or repair shops to increase the max number.
tut.lesson-3.4	And to the left of that are your <sprite name="ui corner"> <b>corners</b> and <sprite name="ui peep"> <b>crew size.</b> Right now your crew is just you， by yourself.\nYou will be able to hire more people once you expand your territory a bit.\nMouse over it to see more details.
tut.lesson-3.5	These buttons on the far left show a variety of overlays and informational dialogs. We'll come back to them later.
tut.lesson-3.6	Now if you look in the upper right， you will see the current date. Today is {date}.\nThis is a turn-based game， and each turn lasts {days} days.
tut.lesson-3.7	If you ever run out of <sprite name="ui action pts"> action points or <sprite name="ui movement pts"> movement points， press the <b>'Next Turn'</b> button to advance to the next turn.\nGo ahead， press it now， and we'll continue once you've done that.
tut.lesson-3.8	As you can see， the date advanced to {date}.\nOn each turn， all of your <sprite name="ui action pts"> action points and <sprite name="ui movement pts"> movement points get refilled as well.
tut.lesson-4.title	The Safehouse
tut.lesson-4.1	Now this building here is going to be your <b>safehouse.</b> Let's take a look inside.\nClick on the marker to open the building info dialog.
tut.lesson-4.2.m	From the outside this looks like a regular business， operated by myself， your uncle {fr}.\nBut inside there's plenty of storage， and room to <b>start a new operation</b>.
tut.lesson-4.2.f	From the outside this looks like a regular business， operated by myself， your aunt {fr}.\nBut inside there's plenty of storage， and room to <b>start a new operation</b>.
tut.lesson-4.3	Let's look at this in order. First， click on this <b>business tab.</b>\nIt's a blue tab on the side of the dialog window.
tut.lesson-4.4	This is the legitimate business that I've been running. It will provide good cover for whatever operation you'll want to set up.
tut.lesson-4.5	Now click on the <b>storage tab.</b>
tut.lesson-4.6	This panel shows what's stored in the basement. There's a lot of booze here， dating from before Prohibition!\nWe'll make good use of it in a bit.
tut.lesson-4.7	Now click on the <b>back room tab.</b>
tut.lesson-4.8	This panel shows what's set up in the back of the building.\nRight now it's empty， but you could start a new operation.
tut.lesson-4.9	Now click on the <b>corner tab.</b>
tut.lesson-4.10	This dialog shows information about the <b>corner</b> we're on.\nA corner is the basic unit of territory - every building belongs to some corner or another， and corners may belong to someone's territory.
tut.lesson-4.11	These are the businesses at this corner.\nWhenever you're at some corner， you can visit all the businesses there.
tut.lesson-4.12	This shows your <b>respect level</b> at this corner， and the respect of other people who are known around here.\nBecause you have very high respect level (thanks to me telling people about you)， this corner became part of your territory.
tut.lesson-4.13	Conversely， this is the <b>heat level</b> at this corner. Mouse over it to get more details.\nIllegal activity generates heat， and heat attracts police attention.
tut.lesson-4.14	Speaking of the devil， here is information about the <b>police precinct</b> we're in. Mouse over it to get more details.\nSo far， it's been quiet. And quiet is good for business.
tut.lesson-4.15	Ok， let's close this now and get back to our safehouse.
tut.lesson-4.16	Now click on the tab with my portrait.
tut.lesson-4.17.m	This is me， your dear uncle {fr}. I told your parents I'll take you in and help you get started in the city.
tut.lesson-4.17.f	This is me， your dear aunt {fr}. I told your parents I'll take you in and help you get started in the city.
tut.lesson-4.18	Close this dialog for now.
tut.lesson-4.19	I've been beating my gums for a while now. Let's go for a walk instead.
tut.lesson-5.title	Paying a Visit
tut.lesson-5.1	See this business here? It's on the same corner as we are. Let's pay them a visit.\nClick on the marker to visit the owner.
tut.lesson-5.2	We are now visiting {name}， who runs {bizname}.\nWe'll go have a chat in one second， but first let's find out more about them.
tut.lesson-5.3	Move your mouse over the portrait， and you will get a variety of useful details about them.\nTheir traits and temperament are useful to know， they will impact your dealings with them. Ethnicity is also important， as people of the same ethnicity as you will be more friendly towards you.
tut.lesson-5.4	This meter shows how they feel about you. Mouse over it， to get more details.
tut.lesson-5.5	This person also owes you a <b>favor</b> or two! You will be able to spend them later - but choose carefully， they don't come often.
tut.lesson-5.6	Now let's look over here. This is how we can strike up a friendly conversation with this person.\nYou can see what they're saying on the left， and we can choose our response on the right.
tut.lesson-5.7	Go ahead， select the first option to ask about buying and selling.
tut.lesson-5.8	If you wanted to buy or sell something， this is how you'd go about it.\nBut there's another thing we should check out.
tut.lesson-5.9	Let's see who they know. Click on that connections button， highlighted in the upper left part of your screen.
tut.lesson-5.10	This dialog displays many more details about this person， including personal info and， most importantly， all the connections we know about - which are limited for the time being.
tut.lesson-5.11	Connections are going to be crucial for you.\nIf you're trying to buy or sell any alcohol these days， you gotta know folks who like you， and who trust you.
tut.lesson-5.12	You'll need to learn how to work those connections to get what you need. But， that's for later.\nFor now， close this dialog.
tut.lesson-5.13	How about a change of scenery? Let's go for a ride. You drive.
tut.lesson-6.title	Driving Around
tut.lesson-6.1	Here's another nearby business. This one is one corner away.\nClick on its marker and let's see what happens.
tut.lesson-6.2	As you can see， some information is displayed， but we're too far to visit.\nYou will need to drive over there to actually talk to the business owner.
tut.lesson-6.3	This is something you will run into often: in order to get things done， you or one of your people need to actually physically go there and talk to somebody.
tut.lesson-6.4	So let's drive there. Click on your marker to select yourself as the active crew member.
tut.lesson-6.5	And now <b>right-click</b> on the location closest to that business.
tut.lesson-6.6	If you didn't drive to the right place， that's okay. Just make sure you're selected， and then right-click on the location you want to drive to.
tut.lesson-6.7	You can see that markers on businesses change color as you drive.\nThe businesses on the same corner as you turn green， to indicate that you can visit them.\nConversely， the businesses that are too far are dark gray.
tut.lesson-6.8	Seeing as this is all copacetic， I have a task for you to try on your own!
tut.lesson-6.9.m	Drive around until you find your cousin {name}. He runs {bizname} nearby. He'll be able to liquidate some of the illegal inventory we've got stashed in the basement.\nI won't tell you where {bizname} is located - that's your first task. But it's near here.
tut.lesson-6.9.f	Drive around until you find your cousin {name}. She runs {bizname} nearby. She'll be able to liquidate some of the illegal inventory we've got stashed in the basement.\nI won't tell you where {bizname} is located - that's your first task. But it's near here.
tut.lesson-6.10.m	Find him and pay him a visit. I'll leave you alone for now.\nAnd remember， if you ever run out of movement points， just hit the <b>'Next Turn'</b> button.
tut.lesson-6.10.f	Find her and pay her a visit. I'll leave you alone for now.\nAnd remember， if you ever run out of movement points， just hit the <b>'Next Turn'</b> button.

tut.lesson-7.2.f	Looks like you can sell her some of the <sprite name="res home-brew" tint> homemade beer we've got stashed away.
tut.lesson-7.3	But you don't have any in your car. So we'll need to come back with the goods.\nClose this dialog for now.
tut.lesson-7.4	Drive back to the safehouse， and let's pick up some homebrew.
tut.lesson-7.5	<i>(Waiting for you to drive back to the safehouse.)</i>
tut.lesson-7.6	Now open the safehouse dialog， and switch to the storage tab.
tut.lesson-7.7	<i>(Waiting for you to view the storage panel.)</i>
tut.lesson-7.8	The store room contents are on the left， and your car's trunk is on the right. Now click on <sprite name="res home-brew" tint> homemade beer in the store room， until you've loaded up 20 crocks into your car.
tut.lesson-7.9	Good， we're done here. Close the dialog.

tut.lesson-8.3	As your relationships improve， you start collecting <sprite name="ui tickets"> favors.\nBecause {name} has a high opinion of you， you now have a couple of <sprite name="ui tickets"> favors ready to use up.
tut.lesson-8.4	Let's spend a favor. In the conversation with {name}， select the second option to talk about <sprite name="ui tickets"> favors and helping out.

tut.lesson-8.9.m	Now drive over to {friendname}， and sell him some <sprite name="res home-brew" tint> homemade beer as well. You know how to do this. I'll see you when you're done.
tut.lesson-8.9.f	Now drive over to {friendname}， and sell her some <sprite name="res home-brew" tint> homemade beer as well. You know how to do this. I'll see you when you're done.
tut.lesson-8.10	<i>(Waiting for you to finish selling more <sprite name="res home-brew" tint> homemade beer.)</i>
tut.lesson-9.title	Exploration
tut.lesson-9.1	Now let me direct your attention over here.\nSee this marker with the <sprite name="biz unscoped"> icon? That's a business that hasn't been scoped out yet.
tut.lesson-9.2	We don't know what goes on in there， but we can find out.\nIf you're not there already， drive over to that corner so that the marker turns green.\nOnce you're there， click on the <sprite name="biz unscoped"> marker to scope it out. Go ahead， I'll wait.
tut.lesson-9.3	You took the time to hang out on the corner and observe the comings and goings， so it took 1 <sprite name="ui action pts"> action point.\nBut now we learned that it's called <b>{bizname}，</b> and we got some idea about what it does: you can see all the details if you mouse over the notification at the top of the screen.
tut.lesson-9.4	Once you start exploring the city， all businesses will start out unknown， and it's up to you to pick which ones to scope out.
tut.lesson-9.5	Speaking of which - it's a big city， and it would be good for you to get out there and explore it a little bit!
tut.lesson-9.6	Corners that you haven't explored yet show up as sepia colored， and you don't know what kinds of businesses are located there.\nIt's only after you explore a corner that you'll find out what's there.
tut.lesson-9.7	Go ahead and drive to this unknown corner.\nBut just as a heads up - this will consume a lot of <sprite name="ui movement pts"> movement points! If you don't have enough， don't forget to advance to the next turn.\nGo and explore the new corner， and I'll wait.
tut.lesson-9.8	So this is how map exploration works - bit by bit， corner by corner， you can drive around， identify new businesses， scope them out， and then talk to the owners to find out what they're buying and selling.\nBut if you can get warm intros， that's much better， because they already start out trusting you. Earning the trust of someone completely unknown is much harder.
tut.lesson-9.9	Great， you're picking things up quickly.\nSo now I have another task for you.\nRemember all the beer stashed in the safehouse? Go ahead and sell it off， all of it! Afterwards we'll invest that money into some kind of a new operation. Maybe a brewery? Or a speakeasy?\nSo go around， try to sell more to {name} or anyone else who's buying， and if they introduce you to more people take them up on it!\nI'll wait until you have <b>{amt}</b> in total， and then we'll continue.
tut.lesson-9.10	Well aren't you just hitting on all six today.\nNow that you have a nice pile of dough， we can start building a new life for ourselves in this city.
tut.lesson-10.title	Operations
tut.lesson-10.1	Now let's talk about <b>operations.</b> The real money in this city comes from manufacturing and selling your own illegal alcohols.\nThe Prohibition Act made booze making and distribution illegal， and therefore incredibly profitable.\nAs long as you don't get pinched， that is.
tut.lesson-10.2	To establish a new operation you need a building you control， with some empty space in the back.\nFortunately there's plenty of room in the back of the safehouse， so we can establish a new operation there.\nDrive back to the safehouse.
tut.lesson-10.3	Good. First， let's unload some of this cash.\nOpen the safehouse dialog by clicking on its marker. Then switch to the storage tab.
tut.lesson-10.4	Now move a bunch of cash from your vehicle and into the safehouse. Remember you can use <b>ctrl</b> and <b>shift</b> keys to move cash and resources faster.\nI'll wait here until you have <b>{amt}</b> stored in the safehouse.
tut.lesson-10.5	Great. Now switch to the empty backroom tab.
tut.lesson-10.6	As I mentioned， the backroom is available. Press the 'new operation' button.
tut.lesson-10.7	These are the various operations you can set up.\nThese are just the ones you know how to run <i>right now</i>. In the future， you will learn about many more， but right now you only know how to make a few things.
tut.lesson-10.8	Since you know several people who are interested in beer， let's build the <b>home brew</b> operation， and you'll be able to distribute it easily.\nMake sure that operation is selected， and then press 'Build'.
tut.lesson-10.9	Great. It will take a few turns until it's operational. But in the meantime， here's an overview of how this will work.
tut.lesson-10.10	Here you can see the brewery <b>consumes</b> malt syrup and empty stoneware crocks， in order to <b>produce</b> crocks full of homemade beer.\nMove your mouse over the different elements to see more details.
tut.lesson-10.11	Also， you already have enough malt syrup in storage， but you're missing stoneware crocks! You'll have to go and buy more， because without supplies this operation won't amount to much.
tut.lesson-10.12	And by the way， later on when you have more money and people， consider assigning a manager to this operation， or installing some upgrades and expansions. They can make a world of difference in improving your profit margins!
tut.lesson-10.13.m	Well isn't this the bee's knees， you're already starting a new brewing operation， and with only a little bit of help from your uncle. Your parents would be so proud. Which reminds me， I should write them.
tut.lesson-10.13.f	Well isn't this the bee's knees， you're already starting a new brewing operation， and with only a little bit of help from your aunt. Your parents would be so proud. Which reminds me， I should write them.
tut.lesson-10.14	In the meantime， you should go and procure more stoneware crocks， so that the operation can start producing some goods for sale.\nI'm not sure who sells them， you'll have to drive around and figure that out yourself.
tut.lesson-11.title	Overlays and Reports
tut.lesson-11.1	Let's quickly take a look at some informational overlays and reports， which are going to help you in various ways.
tut.lesson-11.2	In the upper left corner you can see a variety of drop-downs with additional information.\nClick on the first one.
tut.lesson-11.3	This is the resources display. It shows you who you know that buys or sells specific resources.\nGo ahead and scroll down to 'Stoneware Crocks' and click on it， to see who trades in that resource. You can also look through the other resources.\nYou can also bring this overlay up quickly by pressing <b>Z</b>.
tut.lesson-11.4	You can also select multiple resources， and then mark your selection as favorite by pressing the left highlighted button. These favorites will be remembered whenever you open this overlay.\nYou can then toggle your favorites by hitting the right highlighted button.\nFeel free to try it out. When you're done， close the overlay using the same top left button， and we'll continue.
tut.lesson-11.5	Next to it is a list of informational overlays. Click to open it.
tut.lesson-11.6	There are several overlays here， but we'll focus on just a few right now.
tut.lesson-11.7	The <b>Respect</b> overlay shows your level of respect in the neighborhood.\nYour territory grows based on the respect you have on each block， so it's important to grow and keep respect levels high. We'll talk about how to do that a little bit later.\nYou can also bring this report up quickly by pressing <b>C</b>.\nFeel free to explore， and then click 'Continue' when ready.
tut.lesson-11.8	The <b>Heat</b> overlay is also very important. It shows the amount of police attention on each corner， such as due to illegal activities or fights.\nThe higher the heat level， the higher the chance of a surprise police visit.\nYou can also bring this report up quickly by pressing <b>X</b>\nClick 'Continue' when ready.
tut.lesson-11.9	The <b>Police Precincts</b> overlay shows which corner belongs to which precinct.\nEach precinct has one captain who patrols the area - it might be a good idea to befriend them.\nClick 'Continue' when ready.
tut.lesson-11.10	At the bottom， the <b>Zoning</b> overlays show city zoning regulations.\nBusinesses are typically limited to industrial and commercial zones， but residential zones might have their own surprises too.\nClick 'Continue' when ready.
tut.lesson-11.11	Below that， the <b>Population</b> overlays show the distribution of different ethnicities in the city.\nPeople of the same ethnicity are predisposed to like each other a bit more than average， so use that to your advantage.\nClick 'Continue' when ready.
tut.lesson-11.12	Now the third drop-down is a collection of reports. Press that button to open it.
tut.lesson-11.13	This drop-down lists a number of reports you can consult， related to different parts of the game.\nThe financial report is probably the most immediately interesting one， but the others are going to be very useful as well.\nFeel free to look through them， and then click 'Continue'.
tut.lesson-11.14	Finally the fourth button shows the game encyclopedia， which contains information about various aspects of the game in one place. Take a look!
tut.lesson-11.15	Whenever you have questions about some game element， check here first.\nFeel free to look around， and then click 'Continue'.
tut.lesson-11.16	All right， I'll let you get back to your goal of gathering supplies.\nI'll be back a little bit later， to talk about territory. Growing your crew and your territory is going to be crucial， in order to maximize profits and also to protect yourself from rival outfits.
tut.lesson-11.17	Oh yeah， did I say rivals?\nIf you haven't run into any rivals yet， don't worry， you will. But we can talk about that later as well.\nFor now， concentrate on getting some beer production going! Follow the goals in the upper left of your screen， and buy some more stoneware crocks and deliver them to your safehouse.\nBy the way， as you drive around and visit people， instead of a regular <b>left click</b> you can use <b>shift left click</b> to get right into a buying or selling conversation， skipping other topics.
tut.lesson-12.title	Fronts and Territory
tut.lesson-12.1	Let's talk about another important thing: <b>territory.</b>\nControl of street corners is the cornerstone of every successful outfit.\nYou need to have territory under your control before you can build more operations or hire any crew.
tut.lesson-12.2	Right now you only have one corner under your control， the same one where your safehouse is.\nBut by my calculation， you will need about five or six before you can start hiring more people and growing your outfit.
tut.lesson-12.3	Control over corners comes from respect. As locals learn about you， your respect rises， and if it's close to 100 the corner will switch over to pay allegiance to you. 
tut.lesson-12.4	Territory brings many benefits. First， the more corners you have， the more people you can hire and buildings you can control.\nSecond， businesses inside your territory will be offering you all sorts of opportunities， so it's good to expand as much as possible.\nFinally， and maybe I shouldn't be telling you this， but businesses inside your territory can be extorted for cash. It's a brutal thing to do， and it might have repercussions， but it does produce a steady revenue stream.
tut.lesson-12.5	In order to do any of that， you'll need to set up a <b>front.</b>\nA new front is how you get a foothold in a community， by grabbing a hold of a single corner first， and then using that front to bring all the surrounding corners into the fold as well.\nI'll show you how.
tut.lesson-12.6.m	Go visit your cousin {name} and see if he'd be interested in running a front for you.
tut.lesson-12.6.f	Go visit your cousin {name} and see if she'd be interested in running a front for you.
tut.lesson-12.7	In this conversation， start with the <sprite name="ui tickets"> favors step， and then ask about <sprite name="ui tribute"> starting a front.\nFinish the conversation and pay the required cash and <sprite name="ui tickets"> favor to start a front.
tut.lesson-12.8	Great! A new front has been set up. You can see this corner immediately joined your territory!
tut.lesson-12.9	Fronts serve multiple purposes: they can be used to expand your territory， by increasing your respect in the neighborhood. Also， if you're extorting businesses， they will be collecting the cash for you to pick up.
tut.lesson-12.10	Now let's have the new front start work on increasing your respect， to grow the territory even more.
tut.lesson-12.11.m	Go back to cousin {name}， but this time ask him about <sprite name="ui pip front expansion ready"> expanding your territory.\nThen agree to his price， and he'll get started.
tut.lesson-12.11.f	Go back to cousin {name}， but this time ask her about <sprite name="ui pip front expansion ready"> expanding your territory.\nThen agree to her price， and she'll get started.
tut.lesson-12.12	Good， {name} is hard at work improving your name recognition in the neighborhood.\nIn seven or eight turns， that corner should recognize you and join your territory.\nI'll wait with you until it does.
tut.lesson-12.13	<i>(Waiting for a new corner to join player's territory. It should only take a few turns. Meanwhile you can go about your business.)</i>
tut.lesson-12.14	And there it is! You now have three corners under your control. Not bad， not bad at all.
tut.lesson-12.15	Now here's something to remember. If your front is working on your behalf， it's going to have some costs. Make sure to visit them at least once a month， and cover their expenses (they will display this <sprite name="ui pip front needs"> or <sprite name="ui pip front needs urgent"> support icon if you're overdue).\nAlternatively， you could extort some businesses in the area. Then the front will collect payments， skim off the top to cover expenses， and give you the rest in cold hard cash.\nWe'll come back to this in a moment.
tut.lesson-12.16	Now keep expanding until you've reached five corners total.\nYou should go back to {name} and pay to convert more corners， as many times as possible.\nAlternatively， you could set up a different front， but expanding around an existing front is more cost-efficient in the long term.\nI'll make a note for you， see the missions list on the left side of your screen.
tut.lesson-13.title	Extortion
tut.lesson-13.1	I said something about extortion， didn't I?\nI guess it's time for me to fess up. I've never tried something like that myself. And I'm too much of a softie anyway， nobody's afraid of me.\nBut whenever I'm at my local joint， there's a couple of these goons， real tough guy types， boasting how much they're raking in from offering 'protection' to businesses all around.\nLet me tell you how it works.
tut.lesson-13.2	First， you identify a vulnerable business. Like this one， for example.\nIt has to be inside your territory， and it has to be <i>very close to a front，</i> otherwise this won't work， they won't be afraid of you.
tut.lesson-13.3	Then you drive over there， and strike up a conversation about <sprite name="ui pip front extortion"> protecting them. Be all smiles， but not friendly， you know?\nThey'll get it immediately. And some of them will cave right away， especially those that really respect you.\nBut if they don't， you'll have a new problem on your hands， and you'll have to do something about it， otherwise you'll have disrespect hanging over you.
tut.lesson-13.4	And in any case， remember that extorting people is a nasty business. It will make them unhappy， and they'll complain to others about it.\nLike with every hurtful action， people will talk， and this might hurt your relationships with other people. And vice versa， if you do good by people， they will talk it up as well， and influence others.
tut.lesson-13.5	I can see you're itching to give it a try. Go ahead， drive over to that business， try talking about <sprite name="ui pip front extortion"> protecting them from misfortune， and see what happens. I'll wait here.
tut.lesson-13.6	<i>(Waiting for you to successfully <sprite name="ui pip front extortion"> extort a business inside your newly acquired territory.)</i>
tut.lesson-13.7.m	And there you go. You threatened and hurt some innocent person， just to make a buck.\nIt's a good thing your poor mother doesn't know how her little boy turned out.
tut.lesson-13.7.f	And there you go. You threatened and hurt some innocent person， just to make a buck.\nIt's a good thing your poor mother doesn't know how her little girl turned out.
tut.lesson-13.8	But that's how this works. The people you extort will bring a little envelope to the nearest front every month. The front will then collect it all， subtract its operational expenses， and have the rest ready for you to pick up whenever you want.\nJust remember to visit your fronts regularly to pick up the money， or to cover their costs if necessary. If a front goes bankrupt， you will lose all the territory it accumulated!
tut.lesson-13.9	And now let's go back to growing your territory， so you have a total of 5 corners.\nFirst， make sure to go and help out the owner of your front if they're in need of <sprite name="ui pip front needs"> support or <sprite name="ui pip front needs urgent"> urgent support.\nSecond， talk to the front owner， and get more <sprite name="ui pip front expansion ready"> corner expansions going!\nAnd since getting to 5 corners is going to take a while， continue to manufacture and sell some homemade beer， and keep looking for more introductions. I'll see you later!
tut.lesson-14.title	Hiring
tut.lesson-14.1	Now that you have a larger territory， you can start thinking about adding another crew member.\nThe more crew you have， the more you can do per turn. For example， you can send some of your people to run deliveries， while you personally take care of more important business.
tut.lesson-14.2	Having larger crew will also help you defend against rival outfits. Once you run into them， that is.
tut.lesson-14.3	To hire more crew， look for any business owners who have the <sprite name="ui pip social crew"> hire crew icon on their marker. They know someone interested.\nYou'll need to drive around and talk to them to find out more about that person.
tut.lesson-14.4	As you talk to them， find out about the candidate's personality traits. They're very important， depending on the job.\nFor example， you wouldn't want to hire someone careless to be a manager， or someone weak to be a muscle man.\n(To see a list of everyone who might be interested in joining your crew， you can also open the <sprite name="ui info"> report dialogs and look at the <sprite name="ui crew list"> Crew List.)
tut.lesson-14.5	Go ahead now and try to hire somebody. I'll wait.
tut.lesson-14.6	<i>(Waiting for you to hire a second crew member.)</i>
tut.lesson-14.7	Good! Your crew size just doubled!\nYou can see your new crew member in the list on the right hand side.
tut.lesson-14.8	In the course of a regular game， you would also need to buy a new vehicle for this new hire.\nBut in this tutorial， I got a hold of an old truck that you can use.\nI dropped it off in front of your safehouse. Go ahead and assign this vehicle to the new hire. I trust you'll figure out how.
tut.lesson-14.9	<i>(Waiting for you to assign the vehicle to the new hire.)</i>
tut.lesson-14.10	And there you go! Now the new member is ready to work.\nIf you want to direct them manually， you can just click on their card in the list， and tell them where to go and what to do. They can do everything that you can.\nAlternatively， you can assign them a specific <b>delivery route，</b> and they will just follow a specific delivery schedule.\nWe'll get that set up in a moment.
tut.lesson-14.11	Now finish your mission on the left hand side， by visiting me at the safehouse and starting a conversation.\nI have something waiting for you.
tut.lesson-15.title	Deliveries
tut.lesson-15.1	Now that you have a second crew member， you can delegate some of your work - such as selling off your product， buying up ingredients， or visiting your fronts.\nLet's try that now. In a few steps， your new hire will be running a basic delivery route to get your homemade beer out to thirsty customers.\nOn the far right hand side， click the button under <b>Deliveries</b> to get started.
tut.lesson-15.2	First， we'll need to assign someone to run this delivery. Click on the <b>+</b> button.
tut.lesson-15.3	Now select <b>Assign a driver</b> to put your new truck and crew member on this route. Be sure not to add yourself - you've got more important things to do than deliver booze， after all.
tut.lesson-15.4	Great! Now we will create a delivery schedule. This will be a step-by-step instruction telling the driver to pick up beer from the safehouse， and then drive around to sell it.\nThe schedule is currently empty， so click <b>Add Next Step</b>.
tut.lesson-15.5	A delivery step needs to specify what to do and where to go. We'll start by having them pick up some homemade beer from storage.\nSo first， change the initial step to <b>Storage pick up</b>.
tut.lesson-15.6	Your safehouse is the default location for this action， but you need to select which resource they need to pick up.\nSelect <b>Homemade Beer</b> from the list.
tut.lesson-15.7	At this point we could specify exactly how much to transfer into the vehicle. The current selection is <b>All</b>， meaning to take as much as can fit， which is exactly what we want.\nOther possibilities are to pick a specific amount (<b>Quantity</b>)， or to make sure that there is a certain amount remaining in storage and to take the rest (<b>All but</b>)， or to move things into their vehicle until their vehicle contains a set amount (<b>Until</b>).\nFor now， let's just have them fill up the truck with homemade beer， so we'll keep the <b>All</b> selection.\nNow that we chose quantity， click on the left-most button below to <b><sprite name="ui save step"> save this step and return</b> to the delivery schedule.
tut.lesson-15.8	Now that we told them to pick up homemade beer， we should also tell them to start selling it. Click the highlighted <b>Add Next Step</b> button again， and we'll decide where to go with the merchandise.
tut.lesson-15.9	Change the action to <b>Sell resources</b> and then select <b>Homemade Beer</b> from the list of resources.\nThe list of destinations will also change， to include all businesses you know that buy homemade beer. Once again， you can pick whether to sell them the maximum that they'll buy right now (<b>All</b>) or you can choose a quantity to try and sell (<b>Quantity</b>). For now， we'll try to sell them as much as they'll take.\nOnce things look good， click on the middle <b><sprite name="ui save add new"> save and add new step</b> button - it will save this step and then immediately create a duplicate one.
tut.lesson-15.10	Now look at that - by clicking on "save and add"， you got a new step that has the same setup as the previous one. Of course we don't want to sell to the same business again， so let's change the destination.\nOn the map， you'll see that every business that wants to buy your homemade beer is being shown. You can select a new destination for this step by simply clicking on one of the businesses.\nGo ahead and give it a try! This is a great way to add a lot of steps to your deliveries very quickly and make sure that your drivers are following a sensible route. Once you're done， click the <b><sprite name="ui save add new"> save and add new step</b> button. 
tut.lesson-15.11	Your driver is going to have a lot of cash on hand after selling all that beer， and you probably don't want them driving around with it. So let's add a step to drop the cash off back at your safehouse.\nIn the new step you just created， change the action to <b>Storage drop off</b>， then change the resource to <b>Cash</b>.\nOnce you're done with that， click on the leftmost <b><sprite name="ui save step"> save and return button</b> to save the step and return to the route overview.
tut.lesson-15.12	There you have it - a simple delivery route! And now as soon as you hit the <b><sprite name="ui start job"> start button</b>， they'll start the job on the next turn， and they will follow your instructions step by step.\nThen once your driver reaches the last step on the list， they will start over again， and they'll keep doing this until you tell them to stop. Just please remember that your driver will use up their movement points and action points as they go about doing their assigned tasks， so make sure to choose the right person for the job and use their experience upgrades wisely.\nNow click the <b><sprite name="ui start job"> start button</b> to get going.
tut.lesson-15.13	Let me share a few other tips about your delivery routes.\nYou can rename routes by clicking on the name. That might help to keep track of them.\nYou can change the order of delivery steps， by clicking on the step number and entering a new position， as well as clicking their up and down arrows.\nFinally， you can <sprite name="ui mute step"> toggle if an individual step is enabled or not， and <sprite name="ui start here"> force a driver to a specific step on the next turn.
tut.lesson-15.14	So， I think you've got the basics of organizing a delivery job for a crew member. We got them set up to sell homemade beer， but you can have them do more - for example， they could also pick up the resources you need to make it.\nSo why don't you add a few more steps to buy stoneware crocks as well? Make sure to add a step to pick up a bit of cash， then add two or three stops at businesses where you can buy some crocks， and then drop them off back at your safehouse.
tut.lesson-15.15	Once you've got that going， your crew will keep the homemade beer operation humming. This will free you up to do other things - exploring the city， meeting new people， working on missions， learning skills， expanding territory - well， there's just so much for a boss to do these days， isn't there?
tut.lesson-16.title	Moving On
tut.lesson-16.1.m	My dear nephew， I have a few final words of advice for you.
tut.lesson-16.1.f	My dear niece， I have a few final words of advice for you.
tut.lesson-16.2	First， try to get yourself an additional building. This will greatly increase your base of operations.\nLook for people who have the <sprite name="ui pip social expansion"> building expansion icon， they're actively looking for an opportunity.\nI added a new mission on your list as a reminder.
tut.lesson-16.3	Second， keep <b>expanding</b> both your territory and your connections.\nThere are many opportunities here， but they only come to those who make their name known.
tut.lesson-16.4	Third， there is still a lot you don't know. As you talk to people， try to learn new <b>skills</b>， and try to find out more about <b>resources</b> that you haven't explored yet. Some of those can be really profitable!
tut.lesson-16.5	Fourth， expect <b>competition</b>. Over time you will meet cops， corner hooligans， and other outfits. I'll be back with more advice when that happens.
tut.lesson-16.6	Finally， keep an eye on your <b>finances</b>. Money is the grease in the gears of commerce， as they say， and if you ever run out， this whole operation will come to a grinding halt.
tut.lesson-16.7	Good luck， kid! Who knew you'd do so well so quickly.\nI'll be back with more advice if the situation calls for it， but otherwise you're on your own.\nHave fun in the big city!\n\n<i>(The main tutorial will now be turned off. You can turn it back on in settings in the main menu.)</i>
tut.event.title	Gameplay Hint
tut.event.movementpts	You ran out of <sprite name="ui movement pts"> movement points. They refill at the start of each turn. Press <b>'Next Turn'</b> at the top of the screen to advance to the next turn.
tut.event.actionpts	You ran out of <sprite name="ui action pts"> action points. They refill at the start of each turn. Press <b>'Next Turn'</b> at the top of the screen to advance to the next turn.
tut.event.goon	You just met {groupname}!\nThey are one of the many small-time troublemakers that can be found all over the city. Unlike outfits， these hooligans only occupy one corner， and while they can get very possessive of it， their ambitions are limited.\nIf you're on good terms， they might share access to some illegal goods， or help you in another way. However， if you want to get in a fight， just get into a conversation， start insulting them， and see what happens.
tut.event.gang	You just met {groupname}!\nThis is one of the other organized outfits. Just like you they are interested in profiting from prohibition， and they will likely be competing with you for resources or customers.\nYou can approach them peacefully， or not so peacefully， that's up to you. Just pay attention to how strong you are relative to them， and remember that some insults and injuries are not quickly forgotten.
tut.event.cop	You just met {groupname}!\nPolice officers will make surprise raids at corners with a lot of heat， and at other times they will patrol their district and arrest miscreants.\nIt might be beneficial to become good friends with your precinct officer， perhaps through a recommendation from a shared connection， and then pay them off to ignore your outfit's activities.
tut.event.prod.complete	One of your operations has completed its production cycle. Resulting product has been placed in the storage room at your building.
tut.event.prod.stalled	One of your operations has stalled. This is often due to the lack of source materials. Inspect your operation and make sure it has all the materials it needs.
tut.event.levelup	One of your crew members gained enough experience to gain a new level!\nClick on the <sprite name="xp general"> experience ticker to pick a new ability for them.

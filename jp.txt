outpost.exp-1.convonpc	I had a woman come in， asking for help. Her husband died during the Great War， and now she's having trouble making ends meet. I think helping out some poor widows and elderly would bring you renown.

outpost.exp-5.desc	Donate to a local charity group to assist the poor.
outpost.exp-5.line	Supporting local charity work

outpost.exp-15.line	Sending in intimidating friends
outpost.exp-17.convonpc	Have you seen the state of the parks in this area? They're a disgrace. Dead plants. Overgrown paths. Broken equipment. If a local leader were to only come forward to fund the upkeep， that person would have the respect of an entire block.

convo.sell-price-pos-button.mo	Offer them a good deal
convo.sell-territory-problem-npc	There's a problem， though. I don't feel safe selling illegal stuff right now. It's not that I don't trust you， but rather there's a lot of gossipy people about， and if someone tattles to the cops， I could be ruined. I would feel safer if you were in charge of this corner.
convo.sell-territory-problem-say	Let me see what I can do to make you feel safer.
convo.sell-territory-problem-say.mo	They will not buy illegal items from you until this corner is inside your territory. You will need to set up a <i>front</i> nearby.

convo.later-tribute-button.pos	So， let's talk about that proposition I had for you.
convo.later-tribute-button.neg	We need to finish our little chat from before.
convo.later-tribute-button.any	So， we didn't finish discussing our arrangement.
convo.cancel-tribute-button.pos	Let's talk about our ongoing arrangement.

convo.tribute-confirm-button.pos	That's good of you to say. But we should make things better together!
convo.tribute-confirm-button.neg	It's now our burden to make sure nothing bad happens on this corner. For example， buildings like this old construction， they burn down all the time. But together we can make sure that doesn't happen.
convo.tribute-confirm-button.any	Now that we're in charge， we'll make sure nothing bad happens to your business here. For a nominal maintenance fee. You do want to make sure nothing bad happens， right?
convo.tribune-confirm-cancel-button	Actually let's leave this alone for now. I have something else I want to talk to you about.
convo.tribute-select-state-npc.pos	It would be an honor to assist. How can I help?
convo.tribute-select-state-npc.neg	What do you want from me?
convo.tribute-select-state-npc.any	I guess this depends on what you have in mind.
convo.tribute-select-cash-button.mo	Demand an extortion payment.\nThis is likely to get them upset.
convo.tribute-select-cash-button.pos	Even a small monthly contribution of {amt} would help this neigborhood immensely. {collector} will be collecting them.\n<indent=15><i>(<sprite name="ui convo random"> Demand payment.)</i></indent>

convo.tribute-finish-npc.neg	Extortion? Your kind makes living here awful.
convo.tribute-finish-npc.any	That's extortion! I guess I have no choice.
convo.tribute-finish-button.pos	And we're happy to help those who help us.
convo.tribute-finish-button.neg	I would advise you to adjust your attitude.
convo.tribute-finish-button.any	Then we are in agreement. Now on to other business.
convo.tribute-finish-epilogue-npc.pos	So what else can I do for you?
convo.tribute-finish-epilogue-npc.neg	Something else?
convo.tribute-finish-epilogue-npc.any	What else can I do for you?
convo.tribute-refuse-npc.pos	Hmm， that's more than I can afford right now. I must decline， surely you understand.
convo.tribute-refuse-npc.neg	You can go to hell.
convo.tribute-refuse-npc.any	I don't like where this is going. The answer is no.
convo.tribute-refuse-force-button.pos	Decline? That wouldn't be wise. You know what happens to businesses when a neighborhood has no protection.\n<indent=15><i>(<sprite name="ui convo random"> Destroy property.)</i></indent>
convo.tribute-refuse-force-button.neg	You think I was asking? You watch your back.\n<indent=15><i>(<sprite name="ui convo random"> Destroy property.)</i></indent>
convo.tribute-refuse-force-button.any	You're declining my protection? What a shame. Because bad things happen all the time， you know. All the time.\n<indent=15><i>(<sprite name="ui convo random"> Destroy property.)</i></indent>
convo.tribute-refuse-fine-button.pos	I'll give you a bit of time to think this through.
convo.tribute-refuse-fine-button.neg	You're lucky I don't have time for you right now. But I'll be back.
convo.tribute-refuse-fine-button.any	Look at you， standing up for yourself like that. But you better think long and hard about whether this is the right answer. I'll be back.
convo.tribute-refuse-fine-epilogue-npc.pos	Sure.
convo.tribute-refuse-fine-epilogue-npc.neg	I'll be here.

convo.cancel-tribute-confirm-npc.neg	Oh poor me. No longer protected. Whatever will I do now.
convo.cancel-tribute-confirm-npc.any	As you wish.
convo.cash-boost	I'm having a bit of a cash crunch. Since we've done business together and we know each other well， perhaps you could invest a bit?
convo.cash-boost-npc-1	I can smell a winner， and you， my friend have that particular quality. I'm sure I'll get a return on my loan one way or another. How much did you have in mind?
convo.cash-boost-accept	I was thinking that $750 would really help me get things going. And of course， I'd be in your debt.
convo.cash-boost-later	Know what? I don't like owing anyone anything. Nothing personal， you understand.
convo.cash-boost-outro-npc	Consider it done. Take this envelope and we'll talk later.
convo.cash-boost-outro-accept	Wonderful. Now onto other matters.
convo.at-outpost-button.active	How is our front doing?
convo.at-outpost-button.expanding	How is our expansion coming along?
convo.at-outpost-npc.support	We're doing well， but running short on cash! {costs}
convo.at-outpost-npc.expanding	We're working on winning over the locals. It shouldn't be long. {costs}

convo.tribute-ready-button.default	Good. I believe you have something for me?
convo.tribute-collect-npc	Yes， I have {delta} for you.\nWe collected {collected}， minus {expenses} in costs.
convo.tribute-collect-ok	Good job. I'll be back next month.\n<indent=15><i>(Collect {delta})</i></indent>
convo.tribute-collect-later	Hold on to it， I'll pick it up later.
convo.tribute-collect-other	This is good， but I need to revisit our agreement.

convo.tribute-support-npc	I'm afraid we're in the red by {delta}.\nWe have collected {collected}， but had to take out {expenses} to cover ongoing costs.
convo.tribute-support-ok	A temporary setback. I'll find us more contributors.\n<indent=15><i>(Pay {delta}.)</i></indent>

convo.outpost-cancel1-npc	What's on your mind?
convo.outpost-cancel1-say	I'm rethinking this situation， and while you've been of great help， I don't think we need your help around here anymore.
convo.outpost-cancel2-npc	Very well. I trust you will know how to cope with the consequences of this decision. People will stop their contributions without a strong presence in the area.
convo.outpost-cancel2-say	My mind is made up.\n<indent=15><i>(Close down this front.)</i></indent>
convo.outpost-cancel2-say.mo	This will close the front， and cancel any payments being delivered here. Area of influence might also shrink.
convo.outpost-cancel2-later	Tell you what， let's talk about this later.
convo.outpost-cancel2-epilogue	Consider it done.
convo.outpost-expand-npc	I have an idea for what to do next block over.\n{expansion-npc}\n<indent=15><i>(Your cost will be {amt} right away， and then {amt} on the first of each month. Your territory may expand to that corner over the next few turns.)</i></indent>

convo.outpost.nonhuman-npc	Maybe I am. Maybe not. What's it to you?
convo.outpost.nonhuman-say	I need you to stop it. It's becoming a nuisance and gets in the way of my plans.\n<indent=15><i>(<sprite name="ui convo random"> Demand they close down the front.)</i></indent>

convo.outpost.nonhuman-bribe-no-npc	No way I'm crossing {gangname}. Not even for {price}. No chance.

convo.outpost.nonhuman-attack-yes-say	Life is full of tough choices. But in this case， you chose correctly.
convo.outpost.nonhuman-attack-no-npc	You're a monster! But {gangname} are ten times worse. There's no way I'm crossing them.
convo.outpost.nonhuman-attack-no-say	Is that a challenge?
convo.outpost-weapon.request	There are other outfits in town looking to cause trouble for us. If I'm going to protect this area， some weapons would certainly help. Can you discretely ask around to see if you can find anything?
convo.outpost-weapon.npc	As a matter of fact， I happen to know what's on the streets around here. I can get some weapons for you this one time. What interests you?
convo.outpost-weapon.epi	I hope you will use this to keep your rivals from disturbing the peace of our neighborhood.
convo.outpost-weapon.switchblade	A good knife is a weapon of stealth and in the right hands， quite effective. I'll take that off your hands.

convo.outpost-weapon.colt	A good revolver. Reliable. Accurate. Deadly. Give me that， please.
convo.outpost-weapon.winchester	We need noise and power. Plus sometimes just the sight of a big ol' rifle does the job without needing to fire it. I'll take it.
convo.outpost-weapon.thompson	Sometimes you just need to shoot everyone. Those times call for one of those.
convo.outpost-weapon.pass	Let me get back to you about that.
convo.vehicle-group-button-repair	Hey， you fix vehicles， right?
convo.vehicle-state-good	We do， but your vehicle seems to be running well. If you need a tune up， come on back.

Next time she stops by， if you have some cash for her， I can ask her to direct one of those junkers your way. Need a car?
convo.goons.rewards.offer.blurb.resource-entry.junker-truck	Got a friend who is a guard at a truck parking lot. He says that there are a lot of broken down trucks that no one would miss. He could probably just drive one out， but it would have to be before {expiredate}. That's when they're going to take them to the junkyard. For {cost}， he could get you one.
convo.goons.rewards.offer.blurb.resource-entry.farm	We've got family out in the country and they periodically send shipments of potentially useful materials to us in the city.

convo.goons.rewards.offer.blurb.resource-entry.factory	I have friends in the union. And sometimes they come into possession some manufactured goods. You know， leftovers. The next batch of leftovers should be deliverd {expiredate}. For just {cost}， I'll make sure these leftovers make it your way.
convo.goons.rewards.offer.blurb.resource-entry.warehouse	Got this cousin. We'll call her Dora. So Dora does the books for a warehouse.

But now that your customers have a taste for some slightly better hooch， perhaps I can be of service.\nI have some， um， friends. Yeah， friends， making some of their own product. If you leave {cost} with me， I can arrange a delivery around {expiredate}.
convo.goons.rewards.offer.blurb.business-entry.level-two-high	Your booze joints are getting quite the reputation in the neighborhood. And my aunts and uncles， well， they really enjoy going there.\nAnd one of these uncles， he's an enterprising type， and he's got a lead on quite a bit of fancier booze from out of state. I can pass along {cost} to him and he'd be happy to supply you by {expiredate}.

convo.gangs.cop-effect.at-node.leave.button	I'll be back later.
convo.gangs.truce.button	You know， all this fighting is bad for business. Why don't we try something more profitable?
convo.gangs.truce-1.npc	Oh， you've had enough already?
convo.gangs.truce-1.say	Don't bet on it. But I'm sure you see that none of this is helping either of us make money.\nBesides， I don't want to see someone else swooping in and taking advantage of the situation， while the two of us are sniping at each other.
convo.gangs.truce-2.npc	If there's a proposal here， I'm listening.

convo.gangs.truce-fail.say	Well then we have nothing to talk about.
convo.gangs.truce-fail.epi	I didn't think so.
convo.gangs.truce-broken.npc	So， after intentionally violating our previous cease fire， you have the gall to come back and ask for another one?
convo.gangs.truce-broken.say	Oh， that wasn't intentional. I assure you， I will deal with this mistake on my end.\nLet this be water under the bridge， what do you say?
convo.gangs.truce-broken.epi	I don't think so.

convo.gangs.init-truce-2.say	Speak for yourself.
convo.gangs.init-truce-3.npc	Look， both of us are getting distracted by this conflict， while business deals keep passing us by. What do you say we put it on hold for a while?
convo.gangs.init-truce-3.say	And why would I do that?

convo.cops.fedhint.icon	<sprite name="ui peep">
convo.cops.fedhint-step1.npc	I would say so. We get called on to assist with the enforcement of the Volstead Act.

convo.cops.fedhint-step2.npc	Oh， yes， I heard you've been getting into scrapes with {groupname}.

convo.cops.fedhint-step3.epino	Sounds good.
convo.cops.fedhint-later.npc	Yeah， but they have their hands full right now. Ask me again after {nextdate} and I'll see what I can do.
convo.cops.fedhint-later.say	Will do.
convo.cops.jailpay.say	Say， a certain associate of mine got pinched by the feds recently.
convo.cops.jailpay.icon	<sprite name="ui peep">
convo.cops.jailpay-step1.npc	You mean {crewname}? I heard about that， it was a big deal. They set the trial for {trialdate}.
convo.cops.jailpay-step1.say	Yes， and now I'm wondering what could be done. It would be a headache if this matter went to trial.
convo.cops.jailpay-step2.npc	It would， wouldn't it.
convo.cops.jailpay-step2.say	But if something was to happen to the case files， that could really turn things around for me.\nIf they were to go missing， for example. 
convo.cops.jailpay-step3.npc	That's true. And leaky pipes and accidental fires happen all the time. It would be a real misfortune for everyone.
convo.cops.jailpay-step3.say	Then tell you what， how about I chip in to help for repairs， should such an unfortunate event happen before {trialdate}?
convo.cops.jailpay-step4.npc	Let's say {amt} for repair costs.

convo.cops.jailpaid-step2.say	Well that's a real shame， isn't it.
convo.cops.jailpaid-step2.epi	A real shame.
convo.cops.weapons.inquire	I imagine that you must find and confiscate a lot of interesting things on your beat. Things that could be useful to an organization like mine if you know what I mean.
convo.cops.weapons.icon	<sprite name="res cat weapons">
convo.cops.weapons.look-what-i-found	I think I get what you mean. Have a look in the back of the squad car. I'm going to get a cup of coffee. And silly me - I forgot to fill out evidence reports for any of those things.
convo.cops.weapons.billy-club	Shame that you lost your billy club. I imagine that you'll be able to get another.
convo.cops.weapons.switchblade	You found my switchblade! Thank you， officer.
convo.cops.weapons.colt	Nice revolver. I could make use of that. Of course I'll make sure that the serial numbers get removed.
convo.cops.weapons.pistol	That little pistol would fit right into my pocket. I'll take that.
convo.cops.weapons.winchester	My crew could use a good statement piece. Like that shotgun.
convo.cops.weapons.thompson	You found a submachine gun on the streets of our fair city? My， it is getting dangerous out there. Best that we hold onto that.
convo.weapons.epi	Make good use of it. Understand that I can't lose things like this too often - that could invite attention. But so long as we've got this financial arrangement， check back in a while to see what else might slip my mind.
convo.feds.toplevel.blurb	This is a Federal Bureau of Prohibition investigation. There is nothing for the public to see here. Please step aside.
convo.feds.goodbye	Have a good day.

convo.train-station-start-bad	No one would suspect anything. Interesting. Perhaps if you knew me better， you'd feel differently. Until then， good day.
convo.train-station-start-bad.mo	Improve your relationship with this person to access further options in this building.
convo.train-station-fails	This station has plenty of opportunities that we could pursue. But until it's safely inside your outfit's territory and you've got the cops paid off， it's not something that I feel that I can discuss with you. Come back once you've come to an arrangement with the cops and we'll talk.
convo.train-station-cops-fail	I know your outfit is in charge around here， but until you can assure me that the cops will stay away， I'm not prepared to discuss further dealings with you or anyone in your organization. Until then， I wish you a pleasant day.
convo.train-station-territory-fail	I hear you've got the local precinct under your thumb. That's great. But I need some more assurance that your outfit is in this for the long haul. If you get this corner under your control， with the cops pacified， I'm sure we can discuss further opportunities. I look forward to our next chat.
convo.train-station-passes	With your outfit having control of this area and the cops on our side， I can really be honest with you now. This place is a gold mine， my friend. There's a long， long list of juicy opportunities for us to work together. But there's just one little problem.

convo.train-station-fails-both.mo	Add this corner to your territory and pay off the local cop to access special bonuses at this building.

convo.train-station-all-pass	One little problem? The way that you've said that， it doesn't sound little. What is it?
convo.train-station-bribe-frieght	It's the unions. They're the ones loading and unloading things from trains. If we can get them on our side， then we can do pretty much as we like in the station and the yard. So if you can arrange for some cash， I can make sure the right people in the union leadership are taken care of.
convo.train-station-bribe-passenger	It's the railroad police. It's not that they're against illegal activity on the rails， they're just against not getting their cut. So I think if you were to drop off some cash， I could make sure that they feel well taken care of.
convo.train-station-bribe-confirm-freight	I like the idea of routing cargo in certain directions and using the rails to advance my outfit. I'll get you that cash.
convo.train-station-bribe-confirm-passenger	I'm sure we can use the hustle and bustle of all the passegers to disguise any number of illegal actions. This could work. I'll get you that cash.
convo.train-station-bribe-confirm-freight.mo	Agree to get the station manager a significant amount of cash for bribes.
convo.train-station-bribe-confirm-passenger.mo	Agree to get the station manager a significant amount of cash for bribes.

convo.train-station-bribe-outro	I'll start compiling opportunities for us. I'm sure you'll also have your own ideas for using the rail network.
convo.train-station-bribe-outro-bye	I'm sure I will. Now if you'll excuse me， I'll go see about getting you that cash.
convo.train-station-mission-start	Let's talk about opportunities in the station， shall we?
convo.train-station-mission-start-passenger	Now that we've made some new friends at the railroad police， what interests you at the station? The railroad police have just asked us to keep our illegal activities varied so that no one notices any suspicious patterns developing that they would have to pretend to investigate.
convo.train-station-mission-start-cargo	We can use these cargo trains to take a bunch of raw materials out into some small towns and set up out of town production. Fewer cops. Less heat. More space. What's not to like? Should we get that set up? 
convo.train-station-mission-start-both-fail-npc	At one time， your outfit controlled this corner and had the cops under control. Until those are both the case again， I have to refrain from doing business with you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-territory-fail-npc	While the cops may still be paid off， this corner is no longer under your outfit's control. Until I can trust that you're in charge around here， I'll have to put a stop to future collaboration.
convo.train-station-mission-start-cops-fail-npc	It appears that your agreement with the local cops is no longer in force. It's just too risky without cops under your thumb.
convo.train-station-mission-fail	Understood. I'll get things back under control and then we can get back to business.
convo.train-station-mission-start-one-accept	How about a quick raid on the railway police arsenal? Pay them off and then we'll just help ourselves to a few things.
convo.train-station-mission-start-one-accept.mo	Per agreement with the railway police， weapons available at the station January - April.
convo.train-station-mission-start-two-accept	Let's arrange for some imports from the countryside.
convo.train-station-mission-start-two-accept.mo	Per agreement with the railway police， alcohol deliveries available May - August
convo.train-station-mission-start-three-accept	Let's get that started， yes. Production away from prying and nosy neighbors sounds like a worthwhile pursuit.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-selection	I'm making a lot of booze in the city. But I've heard that some of the outlying towns are starved for anything with alcohol in it. Plus we can sell it to the passengers themselves. Can you get the conductors or porters to work for us to move booze?
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-selection.mo	Per agreement with the railway police， booze smuggling available September - December.
convo.train-station-mission-pass	Not something that I can do at the moment， but good to know that this option exists.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-selection-npc	Sure. And if we let them keep a bit of their sales， that should really motivate them， right?
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-brick-wine	I've got a lot of brick wine that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-cider	I've got a lot of hard cider that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-home-brew	I've got a lot of homemade beer that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-moonshine	I've got a lot of moonshine that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-apple-jack	I've got a lot of applejack that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-fake-wine	I've got a lot of counterfeit wine that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-sparkling-cider	I've got a lot of sparkling cider that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-fake-beer	I've got a lot of backroom beer that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-bathtub-gin	I've got a lot of bathtub gin that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-fruit-brandy	I've got a lot of rakija that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-corn-whiskey	I've got a lot of corn whiskey that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-fruit-wine	I've got a lot of fruit wine that I can move. I'll get that over to you.
convo.train-station-mission-start-four-pass	Well， come to think of it， right now most of my production is getting drunk in town， so not a lot to spare right now. Maybe later.
convo.train-station-mission-one-confirm-requirements	Then an arsenal you shall have. We just need a small deposit for the armory guards to "go on break" and then you can just pick out what you'd like.
convo.train-station-mission-two-confirm-requirements	Let me know what you'd like to have brought in and we'll arrange it. We just need a bit of cash for the porters to have coffee at a convenient time to unload the goods from the baggage car. I'm not sure how much they'll bring， but I guarantee it will be well worth your investment. These country folk don't know what their goods would sell for in the big city.
convo.train-station-mission-three-confirm-requirements	What are you looking to make in the country? I just need some cash to set up production and arrange for the right people to show up to load and unload. We can change production later， but that will cost some additional money to re-tool. Otherwise， we'll be able to do this whenever you'd like by simply having resources loaded and the kind of workers who don't ask questions or talk to cops.
convo.train-station-mission-one-confirm-outro	An excellent plan. Kinds words and guns will make a great impact， I feel.
convo.train-station-mission-one-brick-wine	I've got some customers who would buy some brick wine.
convo.train-station-mission-one-cider	Some cider would move well， I think.
convo.train-station-mission-one-home-brew	Homemade beer would sell well to some people I know.
convo.train-station-mission-one-moonshine	Moonshine is always popular in the neighborhood.
convo.train-station-mission-one-apple-jack	Sweet and it burns. Applejack has a particular appeal around here and would sell.
convo.train-station-mission-one-sparkling-cider	How about some sparkling cider to sell?
convo.train-station-mission-one-fake-wine	Counterfeit wine. That could sell around here.
convo.train-station-mission-one-fake-beer	Backroom beer， please. Beer is always a good seller in this city.
convo.train-station-mission-one-bathtub-gin	I know I can move a lot of bathtub gin.
convo.train-station-mission-one-barrels	I can get stuff into bottles， so if you've got a line on some barrels of booze out there， I'd like those.
convo.train-station-mission-three-brick-wine	I'll get the grape concentrate that they need. I'd expect that they can get the stoneware crocks and then delivery the finished brick wine.
convo.train-station-mission-three-cider	Apple juice goes out. They'll arrange the stoneware crocks out there and then I'll get the hard cider back. Good.
convo.train-station-mission-three-home-brew	Malt syrup goes out. They source the stoneware. I get homemade beer back. I like this deal.
convo.train-station-mission-three-moonshine	I trust them with my neutral alcohol. They come back with crocks full of moonshine that will be dropped off later. What's not to like.
convo.train-station-mission-three-fake-wine	So， I drop off some of my brick wine. It goes onto a train. Unloaded in the country. Something happens. Then I get counterfeit wine to sell. Let's do it.
convo.train-station-mission-three-apple-jack	I trust them to take this apple juice and then start the process. They come back with bottles of applejack that will be dropped off later. What's not to like.
convo.train-station-mission-three-sparkling-cider	Hard cider onto a railcar. A trip into the country and bottles of sparkling cider come back. I'm good with that arrangement.
convo.train-station-mission-three-fake-beer	I make the homemade beer in the city. Then it goes out away from nosy cops and comes back as backroom beer. Consider it delivered.
convo.train-station-mission-three-bathtub-gin	My moonshine. Their materials. In return， bottles of bathtub gin. OK. We'll get the ice cubes ready for cocktails when it's done， then.
convo.train-station-mission-three-fruit-brandy	I get the plums. The do the rest. In return， bottles of rakija. OK. I think we've got a deal here.
convo.train-station-mission-three-corn-whiskey	I bring some corn in， it gets loaded. Then they deal with the part that's prone to explode. Sounds like a deal. I'm in. 
convo.train-station-mission-three.fallback	How about I bring some empty bottles and they fill them up with whatever they have on hand?
convo.train-station-mission-three-not-sure	Well， hmm. I don't know. Let's start this discussion over again.
convo.train-passenger-restart	So， let's talk about another deal at this station. What kind of opportunity do you have today?
convo.train-passenger-pending	We were discussing moving some of our booze on the train and to outlying stations.
convo.train-station-mission-three-restart	Let's see what else we could be making， shall we?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat	Yes. That was lucrative. Let's make more of that at our out of town location.
convo.train-station-mission-three-stop	Understood. So we will have to talk about what else we could make out in the country， I guess.
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-brick-wine	Shall we get more brick wine going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-cider	Shall we get more hard cider going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-home-brew	Shall we get more homemade beer going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-moonshine	Shall we get more moonshine going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-fake-wine	Shall we get more counterfeit wine going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-sparkling-cider	Shall we get more sparkling cider going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-fake-beer	Shall we get more backroom beer going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-bathtub-gin	Shall we get more bathtub gin going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-fruit-brandy	Shall we get more rakija going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-repeat-corn-whiskey	Shall we get more corn whiskey going out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-fallback	Shall we fill some more bottles out in the country?
convo.train-station-mission-three-stop-brick-wine	Now that your outfit knows how to make brick wine， my connections in the country can't help you with that anymore. But perhaps you'd be interested in manufacturing something else out there?
convo.train-station-mission-three-stop-cider	Now that your outfit knows how to make hard cider， my connections in the country can't help you with that anymore. But perhaps you'd be interested in manufacturing something else out there?

convo.outopost.bottle-return-ask	そうだ、ここに瓶の返却コーナーを作ったらどうだろう？すでにフロントが稼働しているし、もっと小瓶をいろいろと使いたいんだ。
convo.outpost.bottle-return-ready-player	小瓶の用意はあるかな？
convo.bottle-rack-build-npc	Sure， my friend. You bring over the materials and some cash for construction and I'll take care of it. We'll just tell locals that bottles will be reused and neglect to mention where or for what.
convo.bottle-rack-build-subsequent-npc	問題ないです。あなたはもうこの仕組みを知っているから、材木を持ってくれば設置できるし、地元の人に使用済みの小瓶を持ち込むように言っておくよ。
convo.bottle-rack-build-confirm	Brilliant. I'll get the stuff and bring it over.
convo.bottle-rack-build-confirm.mo	アクションポイントを定期的に小瓶と交換できるように、素材を持参するミッションを開始します。
convo.bottle-rack-build-pass	On second thought， maybe not right now.
convo.bottle-rack-ready-npc	They are indeed ready. Should I have someone bring them to your safehouse?
convo.bottle-rack-ready-confirm	Please do.
convo.bottle-rack-ready-confirm.mo	Use one action point to collect small bottles. The rack will then refill and be available again in 6 turns/42 days.
convo.bottle-rack-ready-pass	Not at the moment. Let me double check that we need them and have space.
convo.canada-access	You're Canadian and I've become aware that since booze is still legal on the other side of the Detroit River， there might be some opportunities to explore. Given our relationship， I was wondering if you could do me a large favor?
convo.canada-access-start-npc	That is indeed a big favor. I'll need to see who we can trust to work with on the other side - and that will be a bit pricey， so if you can get me a bit of cash to throw around to hire someone and get a building to work out of， I think we can make something work.
convo.canada-access-accept	Agreed. Having someone on the ground in Canada will be worth the cost.
convo.canada-access-pass	Thanks， but I don't think our outfit is quite ready to go international yet.
convo.canada-unlock	So， I'm ready to get started in Canada. Let's get that building going and the crew member on the street in Windsor.
convo.canada-unlock-npc	Just to go over this again， my friend. We'll get a building to store items in Canada and a crew member who will be working for us over the border. Shall I make it happen?
convo.canada-unlock-ok	Absolutely.
convo.canada-access-cash	I was wondering if I could ask a favor given your connections across the border in Canada. I need to get some cash over there to pursue some， um， interests.
convo.canada-access-cash-npc	Certainly. I've got family that goes over pretty frequently， so just leave it with me. It will make it safely over.
convo.canada-access-cash-ok	I'll bring the cash over soon.
convo.canada-access-cash-ok.mo	Start a mission to deliver cash to be sent across to Canada.
convo.canada-access-cash-pass	Good to know that you're willing to help. I might take you up on that later， just not right now.
convo.canada-transport	You once mentioned that you can help me get things over the border. I have things I wish to get over the border.
convo.canada-transport-thawed-npc	Correct. We can arrange that. We've got a friend with a raft who can float things over. Expect the goods on your side soon.
convo.canada-transport-frozen-npc	Yes. Now that the river is frozen fairly solidly， we've got a friend who can drive right over the ice. I know， it sounds scary， but she insist that she can get it done.
convo.canada-transport-yes	Fantastic. I'll let my people over the river know it's coming.
convo.canada-transport-yes.mo	Accepting this will send all goods currently in your vehicle to your safehouse over the river in Detroit. Cash remains here in Canada.
convo.canada-transport-repeat	So how about another trip over the river?
convo.canada-transport-repeat-frozen	Sure， except that the last trip cost us a lot. We had to leave the car in Detroit， so if you can replace that with some interest， I think we could make arrangements.
convo.canada-transport-repeat-thawed	We could， but we had to abandon our boat and equipment on the American side of the river. Cover those expenses for us and we can certainly make further arrangements.
convo.canada-transport-repeat-yes	Just tell me how much and I'll get it here.
convo.gambling.needs-money	Hey boss， glad you stopped by. We need more cash to run the games， there were a few big payouts that we had to square away. Can you get us some more cash to work with?
convo.gambling.excess	Boss! It's good to see you. Business is doing very well， in case you're wondering. How can I help you?
convo.gambling.debtors	Good you came around， boss. I've got someone you should talk to - there's this regular who ran up a huge tab， so I had to cut them off. Not sure what you want to do about that?
convo.gambling.basic	Hey boss， what can I do for you?
convo.gambling.collect.human	How much cash do you have on hand? I want to make some adjustments.
convo.gambling.collect.npc	Sounds good. Keep in mind， if you want me to keep running all our games we need at least {operation} on hand.
convo.gambling.collect.human-epilogue.to-building	I left you another {delta}. That should help with running things.
convo.gambling.collect.human-epilogue.to-vehicle	I took out {delta} in order to fund our operations elsewhere. Do what you can with the rest.
convo.gambling.collect.npc-epilogue	I'm on it.
convo.gambling.ban-gambler.human-start	I hear a couple of players have gotten a little too lucky recently. Think you can do anything about that?
convo.gambling.ban-gambler.npc-start	Just give me a name and I'll make sure their luck runs out.

convo.gambling.nothing-button	See you later.
convo.gambling.back-button	I changed my mind.
convo.gambling.debtor.nevermind	Wanted to check in on you， but I've got other business to handle.

convo.expired-smuggling-booze.post.blurb	If there is a next time.
resultquest.smuggling-quest.beforechoice	Great. We'll get that loaded. We can just settle up for cash. Or have a look in the back of my cousin's truck and let me know if there's anything you'd like in there. 
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c1	I'll just take that handsome payout that we discussed.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c2	Looks like your cousin brought back some apple juice that's all ready to become cider. Go ahead and deliver that.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c3	Crates of grape concentrate could be useful for me. Drop that off.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c4	I won't ask where your cousin got that much neutral alcohol， I'll just ask that it makes its way to my place.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c5	Lots of malt syrup in the truck. Go ahead and drop that off.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c6	Those pistols I saw - the ones with the serial numbers helpfully removed. I'll take those.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c7	Colt revolvers? Where did your cousin - nevermind. I'll take those off your hands.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c8	Switchblades aren't precisely legal， but I can use them.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c9	A good knife or two could come in handy on these mean streets. I'll take 'em.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c10	If I didn't know better， I'd say that your cousin came back with quite a bit of wine. Since I do know better， I'll venture to say it's counterfeit. But I can still sell it， so drop it off at my place.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c11	The cider in the back of the truck has bubbles in it. People will pay a premium for added bubbles， so drop that off at my place.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c12	It looks like beer. But its， um， not quite there. Whoever your cousin got it from， well， they did fine with counterfeit beer. But I'll still sell it as the real thing， so deliver it to my place.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c13	That bathtub gin back there will make for good cocktails at someone's joint. Drop it off at my place.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c14	Winchester rifles. Good find. I'll take them off your hands.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c15	Looks like there's a printing press in the town where we unloaded the booze. I'll take those and the rest of the cash that's due to me.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c16	You say it this was found in a barn on the way back from the run?
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c17	I guess they didn't do such a thorough job destroying all of the booze out in the country， did they? I'll take what you were able to find stashed around.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c18	You found what in an abandoned warehouse?
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c19	Maybe we need to go out of town more often if there are things like this just laying about.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c20	Good. More sugar. That will help me with sparkling cider production. I'll take that and the rest of my cut of the cash.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c21	Those crates of hops will be useful in my beer operation. Drop those off along with the rest of my cut after paying you for them.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.c22	Spices will definitely be useful ingredients for my bathtub gin operation.
resultquest.smuggling-booze.afterchoice	Good doing business with you.

resresults.bourbon-knowledge-quest.eventresult	So you're not content with the drips and drab of bourbon that occasionally emerge from some secret stash deep in Kentucky? Well， then maybe counterfeiting the stuff is the way to go. I know some people with some knowledge that might help you create better facsimiles. Want an introduction?
resresults.bourbon-knowledge-quest.you-yes	That does sound like the foundation of a profitable new venture. Yes， please make the appropriate inquires and let me know what they're asking for in exchange for their knowhow.
resresults.bourbon-knowledge-quest.npc-yes	And so it shall be done. Just bring the cash over I'm sure that they'll get you properly informed about some insider bourbon knowledge.
resresults.bourbon-knowledge-quest.you-no	That's an interesting idea. But for now， I think our operation is content with the irregular supplies we currently access.

city-desc.chicago	<i>風の街</i>は、アメリカの禁酒法をめぐる争いの中心になることが多かった。ミシガン湖畔の鉄道の交差点に位置し、裕福な実業家と貧しい移民の労働者で溢れるこの街は、禁酒法を露骨に無視し、違法なアルコール販売で利益を得ることで悪名高いものだった。アル・カポネのマフィア団、ディーン・オバニオンのノースサイド・ギャングなど、多くの有名な犯罪組織がこの街で衝突していた。\n\nシカゴでは酒は自由に飲めますが、スタート地点はすべて同じではない。ダウンタウンはどこからでもアクセスできるが、バックオブザヤードやウェストループ周辺には工業地帯や駅が集中しているため、アクセスするためにはクリエイティブな人間関係の構築が必要になるかもしれない。橋は3つの地域をつなぐ重要な要素だが、ライバルが重要なルートを塞いでしまう可能性もある。
city-desc.detroit	<i>モーターシティ</i>は、古くから自動車産業が盛んなことで知られている。冷静な労働力を求めて、ヘンリー・フォードは1918年に修正18条の先駆けとなるデイモン法を支持したのは有名な話である。しかし、カナダでは禁酒法時代もアルコールの販売が合法だったため、近隣のオンタリオ州ウィンザーはアルコール密輸の温床となった。密輸業者とハイジャック犯からなる犯罪集団「パープルギャング」は、おそらくデトロイトで最も悪名高いギャングで、アル・カポネのシカゴアウトフィットにカナダ産ウィスキーを供給するまでになったのである。\n\nデトロイト川を挟んで、カナダのウィンザー、オンタリオと隣接している。橋がないため、この2つの都市を行き来することはできないが、川を渡れば船で国境を越える密輸も可能である。デトロイトに住むカナダ人と信頼関係を築けば、国境を越えたエージェントと隠れ家に資金を提供することができる。そして、このセーフハウスに資金と資源を移し、カナダ人のクルーを使って<i>カナディアンウイスキー</i>というユニークなアルコール資源を調達し、デトロイトに持ち帰って販売すれば、それなりの利益を得ることができる。
city-desc.pittsburgh	禁酒法が始まった当時、<i>鋼鉄の街</i>は産業大国であると同時に、ヨーロッパ人のるつぼであった。移民労働者の多くにとってアルコールが文化的に重要であったこともあり、ピッツバーグはすぐに禁酒法の指導者によって「米国で最も湿気の多い場所」と宣言された。シチリアとナポリの犯罪組織が、街の北と南の縄張りをめぐって激しく争った。\n\nピッツバーグには、<i>アップルジャック</i>と<i>ラキヤ</i>というユニークな飲み物がある。この2つのお酒が加わったことで、他の都市よりもはるかに大きく多様なお酒の市場を持つことになり、全体としてより早いスタートを切り、より多くの収入を得ることができるようになる。ただし、3つの川と豊富な丘陵地があるため、領域を拡大する際に障害となるポイントがたくさん存在している。
city-desc.cincinnati	禁酒法施行以前、<i>クイーンシティ</i>にはビール醸造とコーンウィスキー蒸留の誇り高き伝統があり、隣州のケンタッキーからは世界的に有名なバーボンの十分な供給があった。弁護士で薬剤師だったジョージ・リーマスは、ボルステッド法の抜け穴を利用して犯罪帝国を築き、蒸留所を再利用して保税酒を生産することを許した。そして、薬局の広範なネットワークを通じて、このアルコールを「薬用」として販売することができたのだ。\n\nシンシナティでは、密造酒や街の名物である<i>コーンウィスキー</i>の新しい原料として、<i>トウモロコシ</i>を入手することができる。しかし、いったん<i>ケンタッキーバーボン</i>を手に入れたら、それを密造酒場やクラブに売って、もっと高い値段で売ることができるようになるのだ。\n
city-desc.atlantic-city	禁酒法時代、<i>アメリカの遊び場</i>は密造酒とギャンブルの天国だった。アトランティックシティの観光経済は、娯楽とアルコールへの高い需要を生み出し、その沿岸のロケーションは酒の密輸に最適な環境を提供た。\n\nアトランティックシティでは、高級カジノや高額賞金ゲームなどのユニークな機会を含む、より自由なギャンブルオペレーションを構築することができる。また、スコッチウイスキーやカリビアンラムなど、都市に在住する様々な民族から、有利な新しいアルコール類も学ぶことができる。\n\n湾や河口に挟まれた近隣の町が緩やかにつながっているため、近隣のノースフィールドやエッグハーバーにある工業団地や駅にアクセスするためには、慎重に人的ネットワークを広げていく必要がある。

Now they're hard up and she's always asking if I know anyone who would buy their old equipment. So I thought of you.
quest.apple-jack-producer-bonus.human1	Thoughtful. I think I'd consider helping her family out.

quest.homebooze-brick-wine-upgrade.npc2	I confess that I had the same thought. So I checked him out and it seems that he's supplying a bunch of restaurants with backroom wine and can't keep up. So if we can make more， that would get us ahead of other outfits. And he says he'll pay twice the going rate.
quest.homebooze-brick-wine-upgrade.beforechoice	I hear that you've expanded the brick wine operation. Next time our friend comes in， I'll let him know we're ready. Anything I can do to help out with your newly expanded operation in the meantime?

Quite the little operation. I'm sure she'd pay a lot more than the normal rate for your good stuff if you can make more.

quest.moonshine-one-cincinnati.npc2	Bring over some corn and some steel barrels. We'll experiment in my basement and see if we can't build a better mouse trap， ok?
quest.moonshine-two.name	Burning Thirst
quest.moonshine-two.desc	Continue in efforts to improve your production of homemade moonshine.
quest.moonshine-two.beforechoice	Some bad news， my friend. The neutral alcohol you dropped off sort of caught on fire. And may have burned the equipment as well. But I feel like we were close to a breakthrough. If you'd like， we can continue.
quest.moonshine-two.c2	Close， you say? Let's keep going， then.
quest.moonshine-one-cincinnati.beforechoice	I joked about building a better mouse trap when we arranged this deal. Well， it seems I could have used one.

quest.moonshine-three.c3	I'll take on your expertise at moonshine making. And I'll also be keeping all of the moonshine that you made while learning.

quest.cider-three.c1	I could really use more apple juice. So I may as well just make it myself if you can show me how.
quest.cider-three.c2	After all the work， let me know about making more cider， please. And you also figured out how to use filters， so that's useful as well.
quest.cider-three.c3	I'll take on your expertise at making cider. And I'll also be taking all of the product you made using my raw materials.

quest.brick-wine-one.human2	Can do. I'll start hunting them down.
quest.brick-wine-one.introending	Swell. Once we get those， I have some discreet space to conduct our experiments.

quest.brick-wine-three.c1	What I could use is a way to make my own grape concentrate and you seem to know a lot about wine.
quest.brick-wine-three.c2	We didn't vanquish the fruit flies for nothing. So more brick wine， please. And you also figured out how to use filters， so that's useful as well.

quest.home-brew-one.human2	Ok. I'm on it.
quest.home-brew-one.introending	Bee's knees， my friend. Hopefully we can all benefit from this.
quest.home-brew-one.beforechoice	So the first attempt didn't go so well， but I think I know what went wrong. If you can get some more malt syrup， I think the second time will produce much better results.

quest.home-brew-two.name	Too Many Bubbles
quest.home-brew-two.desc	Help your friend restart their efforts to improve home brew production.

quest.building-material-grant.human1	Interesting. But your business interests are your own. Why are you telling me this?

quest.outpost-car.human1	Ideas? All on your own. Well look at you! What kind of ideas might these be?
quest.outpost-car.npc2	Local businesses around here seem to be a bit lax with their car and truck keys. I have some， uh， associates who could look into things if they had some， um， tools?

quest.outpost-car.c2	Get me the keys for one of those pieces of junk at the local mechanic. And I'll want all my money back. And we're square now. Next time， don't come to me when all you've found is a piece of junk.
quest.outpost-car.c3	Yeah， that used sedan from the local used car lot. It's not in the best shape， but get me the keys. And half my money back. Why would I pay that much for a thing like that?
quest.outpost-car.c4	A beat up used sedan? That's it? Ok， well， I'll want most of my cash back. And on top of that， consider us square for me taking this piece of junk away before the cops start asking questions.
quest.outpost-car.c5	A brand new car. Well， that's getting to be worth my time. And money. But not all of it. I'll take some back. And the keys. Thank you.
quest.outpost-car.c6	A new car. Very nice. I think this makes us square for that favor. And you don't need all the money I gave you. So fork it over.
quest.outpost-car.c7	A fancy new sedan. Very nice. Just leave a bit of cash in the glove box， will you?
quest.outpost-car.c8	A new sedan. And I even like the color. I think we're square for that favor. Just make sure that there's the cash you didn't use in the glove box， OK?
quest.outpost-car.c9	Yes， it's a truck. Not in great shape. Not in terrible shape. But a pickup truck would come in handy. Just leave whatever cash you didn't spend under the seat.
quest.outpost-car.c10	That's a bit of rust on that pickup. And it looks like it's been used pretty hard. But I guess I can take it. Just consider us even for that favor. And I expect any leftover cash to be under the seat.
quest.outpost-car.c11	A delivery truck! You've outdone yourself， my friend. Glad I owed you that favor. Cheers!
quest.outpost-car.c12	Well， I really don't want another vehicle right now. But how about next time I go look for a vehicle to buy， one of your friends comes with me. With a crow bar. I find I get better deals that way.
quest.outpost-car.c13	So I assume that you sent out some people who made some major cash depriving locals of their vehicles. I'd like my investment back with my share of the proceeds.
quest.outpost-car.afterchoice	Good talking to you.
quest.vehicle-quest-pickup-one.name	Delivering Favors

convo-repayment.get-town-car-ac.humanblurb	This town gets swamped with tourists in the summer. And their cars. I've got my eye on town car. Something just a bit bigger than I can usually get. I'll let your debt slide if you get me one.

convo-repayment.get-goon-intro.humanblurb	You hang around with some pretty seedy company， I've noticed. Since you seem to be having a cash shortage， perhaps you could put in a good word with one of those seedy friends?
